# üß¨ Conway's Game of Life

_This program was developed using **Python 3.11**. Please be sure to use this version or an older version to avoid any malfunctioning._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main principle

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid are either alive or dead. The game evolves in generations based on three rules: birth (a dead cell with three live neighbors becomes alive), survival (a live cell with two or three live neighbors persists), and death (due to underpopulation or overpopulation). 

The initial state is set by the user, and the game progresses, often displaying complex and unpredictable patterns. It is a zero-player game with applications in computer science, mathematics, and biology, showcasing emergent complexity from simple rules.

## ‚ùì How to use it?

‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard controls:
> - `SPACE`: play/pause

üñ±Ô∏è Mouse controls (_doesn't depend on the state on the game_):
> - `Left click`: makes a cell alive
> - `Right click`: kills a cell

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

You must have installed `Python 3.11`.

You also need the `Pygame` and `Numpy` libraries.
